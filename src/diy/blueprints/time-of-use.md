# Time of Use Control - Exergy HA Blueprint

Schedule your bitcoin miner to run during specific times based on electricity rates, daily schedules, or personal preferences.

## How It Works

This automation controls when your miner operates:

- **Run during cheap electricity** (off-peak hours)
- **Reduce or stop during expensive hours** (peak rates)
- **Follow a weekly schedule** for consistent operation
- **Combine with other automations** for advanced control

## Use Cases

### Time-of-Use Electricity Rates

Many utilities charge different rates throughout the day:
- **Off-peak**: Evenings, nights, weekends (cheapest)
- **Mid-peak**: Morning, late evening
- **On-peak**: Afternoon hours (most expensive)

Run your miner during off-peak hours to maximize profitability.

### Noise Considerations

- Run at full power when away from home
- Reduce to eco/night mode during sleeping hours
- Pause during important calls or meetings

### Seasonal Adjustments

- Run more during heating season
- Reduce during summer months
- Adjust based on weather conditions

## Manual YAML Examples

### Simple Peak/Off-Peak

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Miner Off-Peak - Full Power"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "21:00:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.avalon_mini_3_power
      - service: select.select_option
        target:
          entity_id: select.avalon_mini_3_work_mode
        data:
          option: "Mining"
      - service: select.select_option
        target:

        at: "16:00:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.avalon_mini_3_power
      - service: select.select_option

```

### Weekly Schedule with Conditions

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Miner Weekday Work Hours - Quiet"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "08:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: time
        weekday:
          - mon
          - tue
          - wed
          - thu

        at: "00:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: time
        weekday:
          - sat
          - sun
    action:
      - service: select.select_option

          entity_id: select.avalon_mini_3_work_level
        data:
          option: "Super"
```

### Dynamic Rate Integration

If you have a utility rate sensor (via integration):

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Miner Rate-Based Control"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.utility_rate_tier
    action:
      - choose:
          - conditions:
              - condition: state
                entity_id: sensor.utility_rate_tier
                state: "off_peak"
            sequence:
              - service: switch.turn_on
                target:
                  entity_id: switch.avalon_mini_3_power
          - conditions:
              - condition: state
                entity_id: sensor.utility_rate_tier
                state: "on_peak"
            sequence:
              - service: switch.turn_off
                target:
                  entity_id: switch.avalon_mini_3_power
```
**Note**: You can also make your own utility rate sensor via a helper entity

## Combining with Temperature Control

Time-of-use works alongside thermostat control:

1. Time-of-use sets the **maximum** allowed operation
2. Thermostat control decides **within** those windows

Example:
- Off-peak: Thermostat can control miner freely
- Peak: Miner stays off regardless of temperature

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Peak Hours - Override Thermostat"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "16:00:00"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_hvac_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.your_thermostat
        data:
          hvac_mode: "off"

  - alias: "Off-Peak - Enable Thermostat"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "21:00:00"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_hvac_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.your_thermostat
        data:
          hvac_mode: "heat"
```

## Tips

### Find Your Utility Rates

- Check your utility bill for TOU schedule
- Look for "Time of Use" or "TOU" rate plans
- Some utilities offer APIs or integrations

### Buffer Times

Add 15-30 minutes buffer before peak times:
- Prevents running into peak rates
- Allows miner to cool down gracefully

### Seasonal Adjustments

Create separate automations for:
- Winter (heating priority)
- Summer (mining only when profitable)
- Shoulder seasons (flexible)

### Dynamic Control of TOU Times

Create separate 'helper' entities to edit on the fly such as:
- Create a  date and/or time helper to set the different TOU periods
  - Easier to edit this entity than the automation
- Create a schedule helper to build out different triggers based on time periods

## Troubleshooting

### Miner not following schedule

- Check automation triggers are correct
- Verify time zone settings in HA
- Look for conflicting automations

### Overlapping automations

- Review all miner-related automations
- Use automation groups or modes
- Consider a single "scheduler" automation
