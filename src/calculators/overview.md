# Calculators

Exergy provides free online calculators to help you evaluate whether Bitcoin mining-powered heating makes sense for your situation. These tools let you model real-world scenarios using live Bitcoin network data, regional energy prices, and your specific circumstances.

## Why We Built These

Hashrate heating economics depend on many variables: your electricity rate, local fuel prices, Bitcoin network conditions, and the mining hardware you choose. Rather than rely on rough estimates, our calculators let you plug in your actual numbers and see exactly what you'd save (or spend) compared to traditional heating.

## What You Can Figure Out

- **Is hashrate heating right for me?** Compare the effective cost of heating with a Bitcoin miner vs. your current fuel (natural gas, propane, heating oil, or heat pump).
- **How much will I save?** See your potential monthly and annual savings in dollars.
- **What's my break-even electricity rate?** Find the maximum $/kWh where hashrate heating still beats your alternatives.
- **How do different miners compare?** Evaluate space heater-class miners vs. HVAC-integrated units.
- **How sensitive are my results?** Explore how changes in BTC price, electricity rates, or fuel costs affect your bottom line.
